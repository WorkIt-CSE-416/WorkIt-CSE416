# CLAUDE.md — Apply

Loaded on top of the root `../CLAUDE.md` when you work in `apply-agent/`.

> **Status.** The code is not here yet. Apply moves here from Lisul's resume
> repo as a fresh copy (KAN-534, spec KAN-527), after its personal data is
> split out. Until then this folder holds only this file and `.gitignore`.

## What Apply is

Apply is a command-line agent that applies to job postings for one person.
It reads a job posting, fills the application form in Chrome through the
Fill engine, writes the answers and essays with Claude, and shows the Apply
window (Start, Needs you, Answers). A rehearsal fills the form and never
submits. It runs on the person's own Mac, with their own Chrome and their
own Claude Code login. It is a developer and power-user tool, not a student
feature: students apply through the extension and the connector (KAN-369).

Apply has its own domain language. Read `GLOSSARY.md` and `docs/adr/` here,
not the root ones, for its terms (root `GLOSSARY-MAP.md`).

## How it differs from `auto-apply/` and the extension

- `auto-apply/` is the design document for WorkIt's auto apply (KAN-223)
  and its rehearsal records. It holds no runnable code.
- `autofiller_extension/` is the Chrome extension that students install. It
  fills forms in the student's own Chrome; Scout and the connector write its
  answers, and the WorkIt backend keeps its state.
- `apply-agent/` is a Python program (uv, Playwright) that runs its own
  Chrome workers. Claude writes its answers. Its state is files in the data
  folder, not the WorkIt database. It does not call the WorkIt API.

Both Apply and the extension fill forms with the same Fill engine (next
section). A fix to filling goes into the engine, not into Apply.

## The Fill engine

Apply loads the engine bundle from the extension's submodule:
`autofiller_extension/fill-engine/dist/engine.js`. Apply has no submodule
of its own, so one engine pin serves both. To use another engine checkout
(for example, a branch of the engine that you work on), set
`APPLY_FILL_ENGINE` to its folder. Apply then loads `dist/engine.js` from that
folder. The tests read the saved forms (`test/fixtures/`) from the same
folder. The repairer works on the submodule path in its Repair worktree.

Run `git submodule update --init` once per checkout. Without it, Apply
cannot fill a form, and `uv run apply doctor` says so.

`README.md` is a teammate's setup path, from a clone to a rehearsal. Its
steps and doctor's fix lines say the same thing. When you change one,
change the other.

## The data folder (`APPLY_HOME`)

**Personal data is never in the repo.** WorkIt is a public repo. All of a
person's data is in one folder, `APPLY_HOME` (default `~/.config/apply/`):

- the applicant profile, answer bank, story bank, voice and story map;
- the company briefs and stock answers;
- a `policies.yaml` that overrides `policies.default.yaml` key by key.

Apply also writes its output there: rehearsal records, Repairs, Traces and
the Chrome worker profiles (`APPLY_PROFILES`, under `APPLY_HOME` by
default). `src/apply/home.py` derives every data path from `APPLY_HOME`.

The repo holds only generic inputs: the answering guides (`answering/`),
`policies.default.yaml` (with `live_runs` off) and the profile template.
When `APPLY_HOME` has no profile, Apply copies the Test Person sample data
into it and the window shows "Sample data".

- Never commit a data file. `.gitignore` here lists each data file name.
- For a test run, set `APPLY_HOME` and `APPLY_PROFILES` to a scratch folder,
  so the run does not write into your real data folder.

## Testing

- **Never run the full test suite (`uv run pytest` over all of `tests/`)
  for a small change.** It takes more than 20 minutes. Run it only for a
  major change that touches many modules, and say why.
- Run only the tests that the change touches, with `-k`. For example,
  `tests/test_workday_filler.py` alone takes about 5 minutes; do not run
  the whole file again after each small fix.
- Run `uv run ruff check .` here before you commit. It uses the backend's
  ruff config. `pyproject.toml` lists the findings that Apply keeps on
  purpose, each with its reason.
- **Prove a fix on the real form.** Rehearse the job posting that showed the
  bug (`uv run apply rehearse <url>`) and read its record. A rehearsal never
  submits. A unit test that passes is not the check that matters; the live
  form is.
- **Never press Submit** on a form, and never turn on `live_runs` for a
  test. A rehearsal leaves the browser open on the last page; leave it
  there.
- Kill only the processes you started, by PID. Other people's rehearsals
  can run on the same Mac.

## Repairs

A Repair is Claude's fix to Apply's own code for a fill bug (`GLOSSARY.md`,
`docs/adr/0002`). Repairs are off: `policies.default.yaml` sets
`repair.max_per_day: 0`. When you turn them on in your data folder, a Repair
merges into the branch Apply runs from (or `repair.branch`) and pushes to
this checkout's `origin`, the WorkIt repo. It also moves the engine pointer
`autofiller_extension/fill-engine` on that branch, which is the extension's
pointer too. Keep Repairs off on `main`.

## The privacy gate

`scripts/privacy_gate.py` scans the files for personal data (phone numbers,
email addresses, street addresses, student IDs, links to private repos) and
for secrets (API keys, GitHub and Slack tokens, private keys, cookies).
The identifiers it looks for come from a local file outside the repo
(`private-identifiers.txt`), never from the repo.

Run it before you push any file that you copied from a personal checkout.
If it finds something, remove it; do not push and fix later. A pushed file
stays in the public history.
