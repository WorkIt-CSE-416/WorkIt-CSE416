# CLAUDE.md — Apply

Loaded on top of the root `../CLAUDE.md` when you work in `apply-agent/`.

## What Apply is

Apply is a command-line agent that applies to job postings for one person.
It reads a job posting, fills the application form in Chrome through the
Fill engine, writes the answers and essays with Claude, and shows the Apply
window (Start, Needs you, Answers). A rehearsal fills the form and never
submits. It runs on the person's own Mac, with their own Chrome and their
own Claude Code login. It is a developer and power-user tool, not a student
feature: students apply through the extension and the connector (KAN-369).

Apply has its own domain language. Read `GLOSSARY.md` and `docs/adr/` here,
not the root ones, for its terms (root `GLOSSARY-MAP.md`).

## How it differs from `auto-apply/` and the extension

- `auto-apply/` is the design document for WorkIt's auto apply (KAN-223)
  and its rehearsal records. It holds no runnable code.
- `autofiller_extension/` is the Chrome extension that students install. It
  fills forms in the student's own Chrome; Scout and the connector write its
  answers, and the WorkIt backend keeps its state.
- `apply-agent/` is a Python program (uv, Playwright) that runs its own
  Chrome workers. Claude writes its answers. Its state is files in the data
  folder, not the WorkIt database. It does not call the WorkIt API.

Both Apply and the extension fill forms with the same Fill engine (next
section). A fix to how a field is read, planned from the profile, filled
or read back goes into the engine, not into Apply. Apply's own plan rules
(next section) are Apply-side checks, not fill fixes: they decide what
Claude may draft and what Apply's own read-back accepts, and the extension
has neither.

## The Fill engine

Apply loads the engine bundle from the extension's submodule:
`autofiller_extension/fill-engine/dist/engine.js`. Apply has no submodule
of its own, so one engine pin serves both. To use another engine checkout
(for example, a branch of the engine that you work on), set
`APPLY_FILL_ENGINE` to its folder (`~` is expanded). Apply then loads
`dist/engine.js` from that folder. The tests read the saved forms
(`test/fixtures/`) from the same folder. The repairer works on the submodule path in its Repair worktree.

Run `git submodule update --init` once per checkout. Without it, Apply
cannot fill a form, and `uv run apply doctor` says so.

Apply adds three rules to the engine's plan (`fill_engine.plan` and
`worker._Planned.add`). They stay in Apply: each one is about Claude (what
it drafts, the forms that Claude fill reads) or about Apply's own
read-back. The engine's `fillEach` already accepts the wording that a
try-list picked, so the extension needs none of them.

- A secret question (a password) is never sent to Claude to draft. It
  stays blank for the Filler. `records.SECRET` finds it. A security clearance
  question ("Top Secret clearance?") is not a secret.
- A Workday try-list answer (`a|b|c`) accepts each of its wordings in the
  read-back, because the fill takes the first one that it finds. Only the
  How did you hear question (and a "Details" list right after it) gets a
  try-list; another answer with a `|` must show whole. Keep
  `fill_engine.HOW_HEARD` the same as the engine's `HOW_HEARD` (`rules.ts`).
- A form that Claude fill reads is planned with the company and role that
  its page names, when the link names none.

`README.md` is a teammate's setup path, from a clone to a rehearsal. Its
steps and doctor's fix lines say the same thing. When you change one,
change the other.

## Prompts and gates

- Every prompt names the applicant as `@NAME@` and their school as
  `@SCHOOL@`; `applicant.as_applicant` puts in the profile's own values.
  Say "they" for the applicant, or `@NAME@` where "they" already means the
  company or the sources. Never write a person's name, pronoun or project
  into a prompt or its examples.
- `as_applicant` also adds the profile's `identity.pronouns` (default
  they/them/theirs) to each system prompt. Without them, Claude guesses
  from the name, and a plan or a reason can call a they/them applicant
  "he". Wrap each Claude call that writes about the applicant with it.
- The length gate (`gates.bounds`) reads a limit that the form states,
  also a hyphenated one ("500-word limit"). Keep it in step with
  `essays.STATED`, which tells the writer that the form states a length.
- The not-on-resume gate (`gates.on_resume`) reads the text of the
  profile's resume PDF. With no PDF, or one with no text, the gate passes
  every answer; `apply doctor` shows this as "Not-on-resume gate: off".

## Claude fill

- Claude fill stops at the form's last step and names the button that
  sends; it never clicks it. A PreToolUse hook (`apply.send_click`, passed
  with `--settings` in `claude_cli.drive`) refuses a click Claude names as
  that button, with word to stop. A click the drive guard still blocked on
  the button Claude then names as the submit leaves the form filled
  (`claude_fill._only_its_submit`); any other block is a Handoff.
- A careers page that embeds a Greenhouse form goes to the Greenhouse Filler
  (`greenhouse.board_behind`): by `?gh_jid=`, or by a job id in its path
  that the job API says is shown on that same host (Roblox).

## Form pages

- A Filler with a `form_url(url)` method names the page that holds its
  form. The Worker opens that page, not the posting link. Lever's form is
  on `/apply`; a link without it opens the job description.

## Sign-in pages

- Oracle's cookie banner covers the email step's Next button.
  `oracle.sign_in` declines the optional cookies first (`_decline_cookies`).
- A Gmail search goes to IMAP as one quoted string (`gmail._quoted`). A
  phrase in quotes in the search stays escaped. Gmail can send a mail's
  INTERNALDATE before or after its body; `gmail._arrived` reads both.

## The Apply window

- The status line counts a link as "queued" only until a Worker starts it.
  A rehearsal sends `board.run(queued=...)` each time a link starts.
- When a run or rehearsal ends, its window closes (`Dashboard.__exit__`).
  A window with no server shows a run that is gone.
- `kill <pid>` (SIGTERM) stops Apply as Ctrl-C does: the Worker browsers
  and the window close. Ctrl-C does not reach Apply when it runs in the
  background, so use SIGTERM there.

## The data folder (`APPLY_HOME`)

**Personal data is never in the repo.** WorkIt is a public repo. All of a
person's data is in one folder, `APPLY_HOME` (default `~/.config/apply/`):

- the applicant profile, answer bank, story bank, voice and story map;
- the company briefs and stock answers;
- a `policies.yaml` that overrides `policies.default.yaml` key by key.

Apply also writes its output there: rehearsal records, Repairs, Traces and
the Chrome worker profiles (`APPLY_PROFILES`, under `APPLY_HOME` by
default). `src/apply/home.py` derives every data path from `APPLY_HOME`.

The repo holds only generic inputs: the answering guides (`answering/`),
`policies.default.yaml` (with `live_runs` off) and the profile template.
When `APPLY_HOME` has no profile, Apply copies the Test Person sample data
into it and the window shows "Sample data".

- Never commit a data file. `.gitignore` here lists each data file name.
- For a test run, set `APPLY_HOME` and `APPLY_PROFILES` to a scratch folder,
  so the run does not write into your real data folder.

## Testing

- **Never run the full test suite (`uv run pytest` over all of `tests/`)
  for a small change.** It takes more than 20 minutes. Run it only for a
  major change that touches many modules, and say why.
- Run only the tests that the change touches, with `-k`. For example,
  `tests/test_workday_filler.py` alone takes about 5 minutes; do not run
  the whole file again after each small fix.
- Run `uv run ruff check .` here before you commit. It uses the backend's
  ruff config. `pyproject.toml` lists the findings that Apply keeps on
  purpose, each with its reason.
- CI (the `apply` job in `../.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs ruff and only
  a fixed list of fast test files: the files that need no browser, no
  network and no `claude` CLI. When you add a test file that needs none of
  them, add it to that list. CI never runs the Filler tests
  (`test_*_filler.py`, `test_claude_fill.py` and the other files that open
  Chromium). Run the ones that your change touches on your Mac, with `-k`.
- **Prove a fix on the real form.** Rehearse the job posting that showed the
  bug (`uv run apply rehearse <url>`) and read its record. A rehearsal never
  submits. A unit test that passes is not the check that matters; the live
  form is.
- **Never press Submit** on a form, and never turn on `live_runs` for a
  test. A rehearsal leaves the browser open on the last page; leave it
  there.
- Kill only the processes you started, by PID. Other people's rehearsals
  can run on the same Mac.

## Repairs

A Repair is Claude's fix to Apply's own code for a fill bug (`GLOSSARY.md`,
`docs/adr/0002`). Repairs are off: `policies.default.yaml` sets
`repair.max_per_day: 0`. When you turn them on in your data folder, a Repair
merges into the branch Apply runs from (or `repair.branch`) and pushes to
this checkout's `origin`, the WorkIt repo. It also moves the engine pointer
`autofiller_extension/fill-engine` on that branch, which is the extension's
pointer too. A Repair never runs on `main` (`repair_waiting` refuses it):
its pushes would move fill-engine's `main` and WorkIt's `main` to code
Claude wrote, and only WorkIt's `main` is protected.

## The privacy gate

`scripts/privacy_gate.py` scans the files for personal data (phone numbers,
email addresses, street addresses, student IDs, links to private repos) and
for secrets (API keys, GitHub and Slack tokens, private keys, cookies).
The identifiers it looks for come from a local file outside the repo
(`private-identifiers.txt`), never from the repo.

Run it before you push any file that you copied from a personal checkout.
If it finds something, remove it; do not push and fix later. A pushed file
stays in the public history.
